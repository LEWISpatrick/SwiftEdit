## **Installation**

Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally:

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/swiftedit.git
cd swiftedit
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

### **3. Set Up Tailwind CSS**
Run the following command to set up Tailwind CSS in your project:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

Make sure your `tailwind.config.js` is set up as follows:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        primary: '#0A2540',
        accent: '#007BFF',
        background: '#FFFFFF',
        text: '#000000',
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

### **4. Set Up Fonts (Optional)**
Make sure you include the `Inter` font in your project for consistent typography. Add this in your `globals.css`:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600&display=swap');
```

### **5. Run the Development Server**
Once dependencies are installed, run the development server to see the app in action:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.
